# Try Out Python with VSC on GitHub Codespace

This is a GitHub repository from which you can create a codespace in Visual Studio Code. It is provided by NUSLaw for the course Law and Technology. through Github. You may use this codespace as a development environment for the rest of the course for non-assignment related work. When you create a codespace, a virtual machine (VM) and storage are uniquely assigned to you. We have already configured this to use Python 3.11 so that you can get started quickly. 

## To Get started 
1. Click on ``Code`` drop-down menu
2. Click on the ``Codespaces`` tab
3. Click ``Create codespace on main``

After starting your codespace, you should see your Visual Studio Code editor that looks something like this:

## Things to Try
Once you have this Codespace opened, you will be able to work with it like you would locally on Visual Studio Code. You can:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `hello.py`
   - Try adding your own code to your app
2. **Terminal:**
   - In the terminal, enter ``python --version`` to check that the correct version of Python (3.11.#) is installed
3. **Customize:**
   - Customize the apperance of your VSC with themes
   - Add more plugins by visiting the Extensions marketplace
4. **Debug and Run:**
   - Open `hello.py`
   - Add a breakpoint to stop the execution of your code at that point
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch your app in Codespace
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables to examine them
   - Continue with <kbd>F5</kbd>
